    <h1>hello world!</h1>
    <p>My name is Daniel I'm a freshman in college Majoring in Computer science with a self found love for programming. Self taught in HTML 5 and css, this website is a demonstration of what i've learned in my spare time. I'm very passionate about coding as it is a good way for me to find solitude and productivity in my life its something i wasn't quite sure about, but when I tried it I was hooked. I look foreward to meeting senior developers and experienced professionals along the way. I hope to be a part of something greater than just us ourselves, I want to make a lasting impact on the world for the greater good of all of us.  </p>
